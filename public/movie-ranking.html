            <img src="../assets/images/akeelah.jpg" height="100px" />
                <p>This moovie taught me a lot about spellings</p>
                <p>I love the spelling bee competition and how the words were spelled by competitors.</p>
            <h3>Drive </h3>
                <p>Very beautiful film. Really artistic.</p>

            <h3>Love and Riches</h3>
                <img src="../assets/images/riches.jpg" height="80px" />
                <p>The movie showed me how love is different from riches. To love isn't by who's rich or poor . </p>
